# PacManGenerator
This is one of the first projects that we did. 
Utilizing Javascript to generate multiple Pacman images when pushing a button.
The "Start Game" button initiates speed. The more you push the button, the more speed the Pacman image gets.
I added the "Wipe them all" buttn which is a simple refresh feature.

Areas for improvement:
- Having the Pacman change from open mouth to closed mouth as it moves.
- Having the Pacman inside a built in maze to simulate the actual game.
